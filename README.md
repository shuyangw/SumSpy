### TERMINATION

Your license to the Riot Games API under these API Terms continues until it is terminated by either party. You may terminate the license by discontinuing access to and use of the Materials. Riot may terminate the license at any time for any reason. Riot may also disable or remove from the Game the interoperability with the Riot Games API at any time for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing, Your rights to access and use the Materials terminate automatically if (a) You violate the letter or spirit of any of these API Terms, (b) Riot publicly posts a written notice of termination on its website, (c) Riot sends a written notice of termination to You, or (d) Riot disables Your access to the Riot Games API or disables or removes the ability for the Riot Games API to communicate with the Game. Upon termination of these API Terms, You shall immediately cease using the Materials, including without limitation any Game Information in Your possession, as well as delete all of the Game Information in Your possession.

### API KEYS

To access and use the Riot Games API, You may create only one (1) developer account and You must complete the Riot Games API developer registration process by providing Your Game username and password on the Riot Developer Site and by providing any other information as may be requested by Riot. In Riot's sole discretion, You may then be issued one or more unique Developer Keys for accessing and using the Riot Games API and managing Your account. Thereafter, You may complete the Riot Games API application registration process by submitting Your Application for registration by Riot on the Riot Developer Site. By submitting an Application to Riot, You represent and warrant that such Application complies with these API Terms and the Specifications. You shall not hide, misrepresent or obscure any features, content, services or functionality in such Application. Riot will have the right (but not the obligation), in its sole discretion, to register such Application, and Riot reserves the right to delay the provision or activation of any Production Key and/or any other Materials until the completion of any such registration. You will provide any materials, data and other information as may be requested by Riot to confirm that such Application complies with these API Terms and the Specifications. If Your Application is registered by Riot, You will then be issued one or more unique Production Keys for such Application to access and use the Riot Games API.

API Keys may, at any time, be subject to activation, suspension and/or deactivation by Riot to ensure usage consistent with these API Terms and all applicable requirements, and for any other reason in Riot's sole discretion. You may only access the Riot Games API with the API Key(s) provided to You by Riot. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose Your API Key(s) to any other party. Maintaining account security is very important. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your API Key(s). You agree to notify Riot immediately if You believe that Your API Key(s) have been compromised.

You are fully responsible and liable for all activities that occur using Your API Key(s) and/or Your Application(s) (including acts or omissions that would constitute a breach of these API Terms if made by You), regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by You or a third party. As between You and Riot, You are solely responsible for all aspects of each Application, and Riot will not be required to provide any technical or other support services to You or any user of any Application in connection with any Materials, including with respect to any integration of the Riot Games API with an Application. Riot is not responsible for monitoring or policing any dispute that may arise between or among You, any user, and/or any other third party. Your use of the Materials is at Your own risk, and You are solely responsible for any damage that results from any use of the Materials, including any damage to You or any user's computer systems or networks, or any loss of data.
